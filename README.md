# myCart - E-commerce Web Application

## Project Overview
**myCart** is a robust e-commerce web application that allows users to browse and purchase products from various categories. The application features two distinct panels: an Admin Panel for managing products and user interactions, and a Normal User Panel for customers to view and purchase products. The app is built using Java technologies such as Hibernate, JDBC, and JSP, ensuring a reliable and efficient backend. The frontend is powered by JavaScript, providing a dynamic and interactive user experience.

## Key Features
- **Dual Panel System**: 
  - **Admin Panel**: Admins can manage products, view user activity, and oversee transactions. Access to this panel is restricted to authenticated users only.
  - **Normal User Panel**: Users can browse products, add items to their cart, and proceed with purchases. This panel is only accessible to logged-in users.
  
- **Access Control**: 
  - Robust Java logic is implemented to ensure that access to the admin and user panels is restricted based on login status. Admins cannot access the Normal User Panel without authentication, and vice versa.

- **Cart Feature**: Users can easily add products from different categories to their cart, allowing for a streamlined shopping experience.

- **Product Categorization**: Products are organized into various categories, making it easy for users to navigate and find what they are looking for.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: For backend development and server-side logic.
- **Hibernate**: For database interaction and object-relational mapping.
- **JDBC**: For connecting to and executing SQL commands on the database.
- **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**: For rendering dynamic web content.
- **JavaScript**: For frontend interactivity and enhancing the user experience.
